        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>“We travel, some of us forever, to seek other places, other lives, other souls.”</h2>
        <p>My vision of a better world is one where more women are empowered, brave, and confident in their abilities.
        Where we explore other cultures, spend more time in nature, and come to love our world more. Solo traveling is the best thing I've found to promote these qualities. We become the chief architect of our own destiny. Everything is new and our entire surroundings are an opportunity to grow. My purpose is to provide resources to make traveling more accessible, adventurous, and immersive for you. </p>
            <br>
            <p> I'm guessing that you ended up here because, like me, you're looking for the ultimate escape, a chance to get to know yourself better, or you just want to plan an immersive trip that isn't the same thing that everyone else is doing. You want the life-changing experience, the kind that only adventurers have.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Maybe you're looking for ways to maximize your paid time off, or maybe you're looking to change your life completely, leaving behind the cubicle and embracing an adventure on the other side of the world. Maybe it's something you've wanted your whole life, and nobody around you understands, but your desire for the adventure of a lifetime keeps the dream alive.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I know that's not easy, and it can be pretty scary to go somewhere you've never been before, especially if you're going it alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Welcome, and I hope that you enjoy what you find here. This is the beginning of a beautiful journey. </p>
